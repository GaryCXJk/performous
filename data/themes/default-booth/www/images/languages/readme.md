# Language based grouping

This folder groups each song by the language or comma seperated languages. This is an easy way to sort songs.

## Instructions

Each image in this folder corresponds to the language(s) of the songs. For example, if a song is in English, the corresponding image would be `English.jpg`.

## SVG files and Vue components

You can also use SVG files. These however have to be wrapped inside a Vue component. You can place the Vue component inside `js/Components/Common/Flags`, like before, the language corresponds to the Vue file, for example, `English.vue`.
