# Folder based grouping

This folder groups each song by the folder they are stored in. This is an easy way to sort songs.

## Instructions

Each image in this folder corresponds to the folder the songs are stored in. For example, if a song resides in the folder `songs/90s`, the corresponding image would be `90s.jpg`.

## SVG files and Vue components

You can also use SVG files. These however have to be wrapped inside a Vue component. You can place the Vue component inside `js/Components/Common/Folders`, like before, the folder name corresponds to the Vue file, for example, `90s.vue`.
